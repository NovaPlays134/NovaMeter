# Installation
So now u have it in ur file explorer and right click the file and unzip (extract all) all and you will see 4 things.

you take the first folder called "resources" and paste that into the lua scripts folder you open the lua scripts folder with the stand launchpad by clicking open stand folder and then you will need to click on Lua Scripts u paste my resources folder in there.
