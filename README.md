# NovaMeter
A fully customizable speedometer for Gta with stand mod.

# Installation on github
If you see this i mean ur prob on github or have downloaded it already if you have then skip this part and go to the Installation part
so to download this script in a zip file on github(counts for all scripts) click on the green code button and click "download zip".

# Installation
So now u have it in ur file explorer and right click the file and unzip (extract all) all and you will see 4 things.

The first thing is a "resources" folder you open it just open the stands folder with the stand launchpad with the button and click on the lua Scripts folder.
Then look for the "resources" folder and you dont have it make one and put the NovaMeter folder in there.

Next thing is the NovaMeter.lua file copy that and paste it into the Lua Scripts folder.

Thats it the README file is what ur reading right now.

# end
Thats all i hope u have fun and feel free to leave suggestions for the script anything u can come up with and ill will try it dm it to me on discord (Nova_Scipt#9126)
